# Flight Ticket Booking 
This is flight ticket reservation simulator written in C++. The project was made as a final project of my first year as a computer science student. Our task was to make console application - that is why there is no GUI.
## What is it capable of?
Application uses flight data in CSV format (original data is named "wejscie" on github, edited data is named "wyjscie.txt"), generated by chatGPT. It lets user to choose new flight or cancel the previously selected flight. User should made an account, stored in external file and give all needed informations like name, surname, nickname and password. All data is stored in the files ("klienci.txt", "zamowienia.txt", "wyjscie.txt")
